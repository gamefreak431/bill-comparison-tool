# bill-comparison-tool
A simple tool for calculating and comparing electricity rates.

Current Milestone: [MVP](https://github.com/gamefreak431/bill-comparison-tool/milestone/1)
The first implementation of this is to create a bill comparison tool that can compare a C&I NSW ToU bill with Peak, Off-Peak, and Shoulder. After that I want to make the form dynamic so that fields only appear when needed.
